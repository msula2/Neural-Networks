# Introduction to Neural Networks

## Dog-vs-Cat CNN Classifier
  - TensorFlow and Keras script for building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify dog and cat images.
  - Includes dataset partitioning, CNN architecture definition, training, testing, and result display.

## Diabetes Prediction MLP
  - Keras script for a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to predict diabetes.
  - Covers data loading, preprocessing, model construction with hidden layers, training, and evaluation with confusion matrix and ROC curve.

## Simple Perceptron Implementation
  - Python script implementing a basic perceptron with an activation function.
  - Features training with an adjustable learning rate and testing for binary classification problems.
  - Serves as a fundamental building block for neural networks.
